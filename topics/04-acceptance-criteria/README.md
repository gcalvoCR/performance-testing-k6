# Acceptance Criteria

This directory demonstrates how to define pass/fail criteria for tests.

## Files

*   [check.js](./check.js): Performs simple assertions on responses.
*   [options.js](./options.js): Combines checks and thresholds, and shows how to abort a test if a threshold is not met.
*   [threshold.js](./threshold.js): Sets performance goals for metrics (e.g., 95th percentile response time < 500ms).
