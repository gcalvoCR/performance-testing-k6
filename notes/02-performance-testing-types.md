# Performance Testing Types

---

### **Smoke Test**
- **Purpose**: Perform a quick verification to ensure the system can handle basic operations under minimal load without crashing.
- **Key Goals**:
  - Validate that core functionalities respond without failure.
  - Detect show-stopper bugs early in the testing pipeline.
  - Confirm that the environment is correctly configured before running heavier tests.
- **Example**: Run a single request to each critical API endpoint and confirm it returns a 2xx status code within acceptable time.

---

### **Load Test**
- **Purpose**: Assess system performance under expected user load to ensure it meets performance requirements.
- **Key Goals**:
  - Measure response time, throughput, and resource consumption under realistic traffic conditions.
  - Identify performance bottlenecks and scalability limits within the expected usage range.
  - Validate SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for performance.
- **Example**: Simulate 100‚Äì500 concurrent users making standard requests over 10 minutes and verify that the API maintains <500ms average response time.

---

### **Stress Test**
- **Purpose**: Determine the system‚Äôs robustness by pushing it beyond its expected capacity until it fails.
- **Key Goals**:
  - Identify the system‚Äôs breaking point.
  - Observe system behavior under overload conditions.
  - Evaluate how well the system recovers after failure.
- **Example**: Continuously increase the number of Virtual Users (VU) until the API returns HTTP 500 errors or latency degrades significantly.

---

### **Spike Test**
- **Purpose**: Evaluate how the system handles sudden, extreme changes in load followed by rapid drops.
- **Key Goals**:
  - Simulate unexpected traffic surges.
  - Test how quickly the system can scale up and down.
  - Identify transient failures or recovery lags.
- **Example**: Jump from 10 to 1000 VUs in a few seconds, hold briefly, and then drop back to 10.

---

### **Soak Test (Endurance Test)**
- **Purpose**: Assess the long-term stability and performance of the system under sustained load.
- **Key Goals**:
  - Detect memory leaks, slow resource leaks, or degradation over time.
  - Confirm that the system remains stable over prolonged usage.
  - Identify issues that may only surface after hours of activity.
- **Example**: Simulate 200 VUs making regular requests for 8 hours and monitor CPU, memory usage, and response times throughout.

## When to Use Each Test

## When to Use Each Test Type

Choosing the right type of performance test depends on the stage of development and the performance risks you want to uncover:

| Test Type   | When to Use                                                                 |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Smoke**   | After deploying new builds to verify basic functionality and stability.      |
| **Load**    | Before release, to ensure the system can handle expected production traffic. |
| **Stress**  | During performance tuning or pre-launch to find system limits and failure modes. |
| **Spike**   | To simulate promotional events, flash sales, or viral usage spikes.          |
| **Soak**    | To validate long-term system stability, especially for always-on services.   |

# üîß Public & Mock APIs for Practicing Performance Testing

Use these APIs and tools to safely practice Load, Spike, Stress, and Soak Testing with tools like **K6**, **JMeter**, or **Locust**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Most public APIs have **rate limits**. Use low to moderate load unless explicitly allowed.
